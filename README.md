Demo

An illustration of how Javascript tells a story.  Inspired by Tiny Data Visualization by Matthew Strom.
Check out his slides http://slides.com/matthewstrom/tinycharts#/13

Slide 13 shows miniature graphs using real data rather than numbers.

For this example, the illustration is in seeing a trend in the cost of genome sequencing.
